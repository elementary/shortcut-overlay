# shortcut-overlay

A native OS-wide shortcut overlay to be launched by Gala.

This GTK+ applet should read window manager and OS keyboard shortcuts from dconf
and expose them to the user when launched. Inspired by the similar [feature][1]
of Ubuntu Unity introduced in Ubuntu 12.04.

## Super rough sketch

![Super rough sketch](/data/sketch.jpg)

The shortcut window should open centered on the primary display, probably styled like a dialog. It should have two columns of keyboard shortcuts, and could have a gear in the titlebar that opens the [system keyboard settings](settings://input/keyboard/shortcuts).

## Included Shortcuts

We need to decide which shortcuts are included, how they're sorted, and if they're grouped into smaller categories. [Read this document](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/elementary-OS-Shortcut-Overlay-z3oP5UefS11B2OpOZpKE5?_tk=share_copylink) to that effect.

## Building, Testing, and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:
* libgee-0.8-dev
* libgranite-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* meson
* valac


Run `meson build` to configure the build environment and then change to the build directory and run `ninja` to build

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `io.elementary.shortcut-overlay`

    sudo ninja install
    io.elementary.shortcut-overlay
